![shiny and quarto logo](shiny.png)

Thsi was my first shiny app. i was not going to originally use shint. i thin iwa nted to use flexxdashboard, but decided to use shiny along the way. It most combineds shiny and quarto. i think the nect one i build witll be fully shiny. it is still shiny, but equal parts quarto. i still use bslib i got the data from the nhs wales site and from stats.goec.uk.
